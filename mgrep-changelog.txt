Version 1.0: Thursday March 6, 2008
- added --hidden option to allow scanning of hidden files/directories
- now skips symlinks immediately
- cleaned has been beautified, cleaner handling of files vs. STDIN

Version 0.9.9: Tuesday January 29, 2008
- mgrep [options] [-#] ( [-n] regex ) [filenames]
- added the --all option to scan the entire file and check results (instead 
  of scanning and having a single line match all the criteria).
- now parses directories, so the filename can be a directory, it will
  recursively check every file under that directory
- code has been uglified, expect it to be cleaned for version 1.0

Version 0.9: Saturday January 26, 2008
- mgrep [-#] ( [-n] regex ) [filenames]
- there are no options yet, although this could implement almost
  all of grep or awk's options so I may check that out.  As well
  as formatting output differently.
